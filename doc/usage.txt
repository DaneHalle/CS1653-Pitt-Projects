FileSharing Usage Information

USAGE:
 To start Group Server: java RunGroupServer [(optional) port number]
 When the group server is first started, there are no users or groups. Since 
 there must be an administer of the system, the user is prompted via the console
 to enter a username. This name becomes the first user and is a member of the
 ADMIN group.  Also, no groups exist.  The group server's port will be randomized 
 unless a port number is specified as the first command line argument. 

 To start the File Server: java RunFileServer [(optional) port number]
 The file server will create a shared_files inside the working directory if one 
 does not exist. The file server is now online.  The file server's port will be 
 randomized unless a port number is specified as the first command line argument. 

To start a Client Instance: java RunClient
The client must specify a connection to a given server. To do this, do the following:
connect group [ip] [port]
connect file [ip] [port]
From there, you should be connected to both the Group and File servers and can 
use the server. 

 To reset the File server completely, delete FileList.bin and the shared_files 
 directory.
 To reset the Group Server, delete UserList.bin.
 
 Note that this implementation supports server side directories.
