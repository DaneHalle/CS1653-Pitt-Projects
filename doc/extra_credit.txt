ExtraCredit Least Privilege

We implemented a Least Privilege system of sorts. 
If a user want access to commands that would affect a group of some kind, 
they must explicitly specify it with a command. User's can only escalate 
their privlege on groups they are already apart of. The following functionallity 
allows for this to be done:

SHOW <GROUPNAME> - Adds GROUPNAME to the current user's scope allowing for commands 
					affecting the File system and Group system to be used.
SHOWALL - Adds all groups available to a current user to the scope allowing for 
			commands affecting the File and Group systems to be used.
HIDE <GROUPNAME> - Removes GROUPNAME from the current user's scope disallowing for 
					commands affecting the File and Group systems from being used.
HIDEALL - Removes all groups from the current user's scope disallowing commands 
			affecting the File and Group systems from being used. 

This was achieved by altering the User structures of Token.java and UserList.java. 
Should a user want to reset their scope entirely without one of the above commands, 
they can either relog or re-retieve their token with a GET.
