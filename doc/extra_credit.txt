ExtraCredit Least Privilege
---------------------------
We implemented a Least Privilege system of sorts.
If a user want access to commands that would affect a group of some kind,
they must explicitly specify it with a command. User's can only escalate
their privlege on groups they are already apart of. The following functionallity
allows for this to be done:

SHOW <GROUPNAME> - Adds GROUPNAME to the current user's scope allowing for commands
					affecting the File system and Group system to be used.
SHOWALL - Adds all groups available to a current user to the scope allowing for
			commands affecting the File and Group systems to be used.
HIDE <GROUPNAME> - Removes GROUPNAME from the current user's scope disallowing for
					commands affecting the File and Group systems from being used.
HIDEALL - Removes all groups from the current user's scope disallowing commands
			affecting the File and Group systems from being used.

This was achieved by altering the User structures of Token.java and UserList.java.
Should a user want to reset their scope entirely without one of the above commands,
they can either relog or re-retieve their token with a GET.


ExtraCredit Client GUI
----------------------
We implemented a basic client gui for a user ti interact with the system without
the use of the command line. This was done using java swing and java awt. All
the functionallity from the cli client is built into the GUI with either a drop
down menu or buttons within the interface. A console in the middle of the
application lets the user see the progress of their commands and if they
succeeded or failed.
